**Context**

DevOps course students undergo practice on cloud infrastructure.

Virtual machines often break down and students have to wait for support to fix them because they use 1 machine for the entire course and it is important for them to continue to use the work done on it.

**Problem**

Students spend time troubleshooting the virtual machine and waiting for repairs. This leads to falling behind and loss of motivation.

**Context**

DevOps course students undergo practice on cloud infrastructure.

Virtual machines often break down and students have to wait for support to fix them because they use 1 machine for the entire course and it is important for them to continue to use the work done on it.

**Problem**

Students spend time troubleshooting the virtual machine and waiting for repairs. This leads to falling behind and loss of motivation.

**Solution**

Create separate virtual machines on demand, so that at any moment you can quickly re-request the resources needed for practice

**Result**

**Solution**

Leave only two communication flows with the team - a feedback form on the educational platform and a single first line of support

**Result**

Reduced SLI by half
